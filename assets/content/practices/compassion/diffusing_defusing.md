title: Diffusing/Defusing (D/D)
---

Take an existing unpleasant emotion for contemplation. Open to the Dukkha. 
We can then universalize it by opening to vivid examples of humans or other living beings who may experience these emotions intensely. 
Trying to open out & have Compassion/Lovingkindness to them. e.g. aloneness, rejection. 
What other Living Beings may be experiencing this?

A systematic way of doing the DD:
First part is to start with yourself, then consider someone else, with similar Dukkha who is the same age and same sex, then same age & opposite sex, then add 10 years and both sexes, then go down 10 years and both sexes, then up 20, down 20 and continuing until we have gone down to little children and up to ~100-year-olds.
In the second part of the meditation, use your own age and sex.
Consider many people similar to you but gradually imagine their Dukkha getting more and more intense.
The first part of this meditation shows us that we are not alone with our Dukkha. Many people all different ages experience the same types of Dukkha. This helps us to know that it is not just "me, me, me, I am the only one who has this Dukkha!"
The second part of this DD Compassion/Lovingkindness meditation shows us that our Dukkha is not so big, if we compare it to others. This helps us greatly to let go of our attachment to it.
