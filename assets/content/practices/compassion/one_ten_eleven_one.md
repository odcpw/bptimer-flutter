Imagine you are in town and you meet another person your same age and sex. Then you start having a conversation with them. As they talk, though, they are very sad and upset. They talk about all of the difficulties that they have had in their life and how bad it has all been. All of these difficulties are just the same as you have had. Yet they are feeling very sad and upset. Can you have Compassion/Lovingkindness for them?

Their problems are similar to your own. They are very sad and upset.
Wish them a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.

Now as you are still in town you go to a restaurant to eat and you meet that same person again. They are sitting and eating with nine other people, similar age and the same sex. But they are all sad and upset talking about the hardships and difficulties they have had. And all these hardships and difficulties are similar to those you have had. Yet they are feeling very sad and upset. Can you have Compassion/Lovingkindness for these ten people, similar age and sex to you, with similar life difficulties?

Their problems are similar to your own. They are very sad and upset.
Wish these ten people a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.

Now you join them. Eleven people, all a similar age and sex. All with similar difficulties and challenges in life. Can you have Compassion/Lovingkindness for all eleven of these people -- as a group of people -- with you as one of them?

All of you have similar difficulties and challenges. Wish all eleven people a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.

Now let the ten people go away. And you are left with just yourself. A human being with your own difficulties and challenges. Can you have Compassion/Lovingkindness for yourself?

Another person in the world with your own difficulties and challenges.
Wish yourself a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.
