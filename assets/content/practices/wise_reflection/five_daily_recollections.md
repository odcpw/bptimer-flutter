Traditional contemplations: 

I am of the nature to decay
I have not gone beyond decay
I am of the nature to be diseased
I have not gone beyond disease
I am of the nature to die
I have not gone beyond death
All that is mine, dear and delightful, will change and vanish
I am the owner of my Kamma
I am the heir to my Kamma
I am born of my Kamma
I am related to my Kamma
I abide supported by my Kamma
Of whatever Kamma I shall do, whether wholesome or unwholesome, of that I will be the heir
