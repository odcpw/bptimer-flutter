title: Five/Seven Reflections
---

1) How fortunate I am, 2) Death, 3) Actions and Results, 4) Dukkha, 5) Impermanence, 6) No problems only challenges, 7) Compassion and Equanimity.

These are some suggestions on how to do the Reflection meditations in long form

With regard to "How fortunate you are" reflection:
Simply reflect on all the different ways that you are fortunate, material and mental. Watch out for the word "but" - it is not part of this reflection.

With regard to Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) reflection:
One way to reflect is to think of every single type of Dukkha that you can imagine. Using systems helps with this, such as:
**the alphabet with occupations: What types of Dukkha can airplane pilots experience?, bankers, cooks, doctors, etc.
**body parts: What kinds of Dukkha can occur in the toes?, feet, legs, hips, etc.; inside also like cancer, diarrhea, etc.
**ages: from 1 to 100, What kinds of Dukkha can come for babies, one year olds, two, etc.
**alphabet with mental Dukkha: anger, boredom, craving, etc.

With regard to Death & Impermanence reflection:
We could do similar to the Dukkha reflection and go through systems considering every different way in which one could die.

With regard to the reflection on "Actions & the results of Actions":
One way of reflecting can be what we call "Inward and Outward".
Concerning "Actions & the results of Actions"; Inward is where we look into our past and consider an experience and the results of it. If it was a beneficial action and beneficial results then we try to remember it so we can repeat it in the future, should a similar experience come about. If it was an unbeneficial action and unbeneficial results, then we try to understand how we could have done it better. We could also consider what others would have done in a similar event. Especially thinking about what people we respect would have done.
Outward is where we look at others and things which we have read about or seen that have happened. Then we contemplate how the actions were beneficial or unbeneficial as above. And we consider what we would do in a similar situation. By reflecting in these ways, we try to develop the understanding of how to react in a wise and beneficial way in the future.

With regard to the reflection, "the Relationship of Compassion and Equanimity":
The reflection on "the Relationship of Compassion and Equanimity" is basically a smaller part of the above. But in this reflection we try to contemplate about situations in which a balance of Compassion and Equanimity was needed. We try to think of times when it was in balance and times when it was not and reflect how to increase this balance or how to correct the imbalance.

Again this can be Inward and Outward. An outward example of balanced Compassion and Equanimity is Mother Theresa's life story. When she went to India she was filled with Compassion and kept it balanced with Equanimity. She did not allow her Compassion to go into grief nor go into anger. An example of unbalanced Compassion and Equanimity is the Oklahoma (USA) bombing of a government building some years ago. Supposedly the men who did it had some sort of compassion for the USA and wanted to "wake-up, etc." the American people. However their compassion went strongly into aversion.

PS. These various systems can also work with the Compassion/Lovingkindness meditation.
