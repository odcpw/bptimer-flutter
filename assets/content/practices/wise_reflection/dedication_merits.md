title: Dedication of Direction & Merits

**Dedication of Direction**
May I take this opportunity to rededicate my intention to develop the Paramis as much as I can, so that I can be of the most possible benefit to myself and all
beings.

**Dedication of Merits**
This is another practice which can help us develop more Right Understanding and Right Intention. Briefly speaking, it is taught that we can share the benefit of any good Kamma we have done with other living beings. We encourage you to end each day with a similar dedication. For those of you who are really keen, you could end each formal session with the dedication.
This dedication helps to give a sense of contentment and joy with your efforts. You remember that you are not doing this practice just for yourself and your own peace, but also for the benefit and welfare of all beings - through Compassion for the world.
May what I have done, to help purify the mind, be of some help to benefit all beings.
