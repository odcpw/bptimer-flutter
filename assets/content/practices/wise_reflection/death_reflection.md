title: Death Reflection
---

Think of _______ who has died. Picture _______ alive and doing something.

Whatever you can imagine, maybe you only saw a photo of them so imagine them talking, walking, sitting, whatever. Don't get involved in a story about them. Just picture _______ alive, doing something.

Now remember that they are dead, gone, no longer a part of this world.

Bring this awareness to yourself, that you, too, will definitely die one day.

"Verily, also, my own body is of the same nature, such it will become and will not escape it."

May they be able to have the opportunity to develop the mind. But if death comes unexpectedly, may they be able to have contentment or peace. May they use their
precious opportunity to develop beneficial qualities.
