title: Origination and Dissolution
---

Think of an external inanimate material object that you like very much - something you feel you are quite attached in some way, something you use a lot or that you consider yours.

Now please trace this object back in time to see its source. Consider how it came to you.

Where was this object found, given to you or sold?

Where was this object made?

Now please break it down into the four elements of earth, water, wind and fire?

How did the elements get to the place where the object was created?

What form were the elements in then?

Were they dug up from somewhere? - metal (earth), grown somewhere (plant) did they depend on the earth, water, wind and fire for that process?

Did they come from Nature?

Will this object that you like ever change or age?

Imagine it changing or aging

Will the object ever cease to be in the form it is in now?

Will the object return to Nature?

Can you prevent this happening?

Is the object then really yours?

Who does it belong to?

Is your body also composed of these four elements of earth, water, wind and fire?

Did it also come from Nature?

Can the body be separated from the four elements of Nature for very long and still survive in the form it is in now?

Has the body ever changed or aged?

Imagine the body changing or aging?

Will it return to Nature?

Can you prevent this happening?

Can the body ultimately be yours?
